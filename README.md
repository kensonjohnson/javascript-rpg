## Description

This repo is for me to follow along with the [Pizza Legends RPG](https://www.coopmode.dev/series/pizza-legends-rpg/) tutorial series.
All credit for the game code and assets goes to the awesome devs at [Coop Mode](https://www.coopmode.dev/).
The only differences between this repo and the tutorial code is that I'm using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and TypeScript.

This game uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
